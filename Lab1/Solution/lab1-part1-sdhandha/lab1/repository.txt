If you are on the master branch and modify a file (let’s call the modified version v1) and then add the file into the staging area by doing “git add file”.

Which version of the file gets committed?- This time again the v1 version of the file get committed as that has been staged, the changes made to the new file(v2) has not been staged and hence it will not get committed, instead a previous staged file would be committed.
